<br />

**BACKGROUND**
<br />
The initial objectives of the invasion have been completed. The airport, seaport, and coastal road connecting them have been captured.

In addition, a significant amount of the enemy's heavy units have been reduced in effectiveness. The 1. Mechanized has suffered significant enough losses that it is down to a single company's strength.

The British intend to land on Malden in the coming days. It is vital that the Maldenese Defense Force capitulate before they can be reinforced by foreign intervention.

<br />

**SITUATION**
<br />
You will deploy by inflatable boat off the northwest coast, just off of the town of Goisse. You will determine where the disembarking point will be.

The separatist elements in place on the island have been scattered during the invasion and have taken losses. A cell has made contact and has arranged to guide friendly forces after meeting up. You will arrange a location to rendezvous before the mission begins. Their radio frequency is 70.0 

After gathering intelligence from the separatists, you will move to Mission Point 2 and locate the enemy brigade headquarters somewhere in the area of Mission Point 3. 

Once the enemy headquarters is located, you may use your discretion whether to destroy it by stand-off attack or to assault it and seize any documents or valuable prisoners inside.

On the way to Mission Point 2, you may encounter enemy forces withdrawing through your AO around Mission Point 1. If the opportunity presents itself, you are to engage and ambush any vulnerable enemy units withdrawing.

Civilian refugees are choking the roads and making the enemy withdrawal difficult, this may work to your advantage.

Operation will begin at 2330.
