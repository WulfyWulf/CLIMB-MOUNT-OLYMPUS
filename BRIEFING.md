<br />

**BACKGROUND**
<br />
The elected government of the Republic of Malden has been overthrown in a probable NATO-backed coup. The former government sought natural gas deliveries and future basing rights that benefited the Russian Federation.

More urgently, several assets of interests to the Russian Federation have been seized following the coup. Russian nationals have been interned by local forces.

Sporadic fighting in Malden continues with small elements of troops loyal to the deposed government fighting coup forces. The new Maldenese government is using this as an excuse to indefinitely hold Russian assets.

The Republic of Malden has ignored multiple ultimatums leading up to this point, and mediation with the United Kingdom, with which the Republic of Malden maintains close relations with, has stalled. The Black Sea Fleet has been redeployed from anchor in Tartus and is patrolling offshore.

The Maldenese Armed Forces have begun mobilizing and are appealing to NATO, of which they are not a member, for military assistance.

Russia has no intention of allowing these repeated offenses to go unpunished.

<br />

**SITUATION**
<br />
The small island of Moray, located within the territorial waters of the Republic of Malden (ROM) has already been seized by covert assault. There is no indication that these activities have been discovered on the mainland due to communications jamming during the assault and seizure of the island and its population.

Contact has been made with elements in the Maldenese Defense Force (MDF) that have been remain loyal to the now deposed government that seek to assist in a prompt takeover of the main air and naval stations on the island. Confidence in these forces is high. These assets will be in position to overpower local resistance once friendly infiltration and objectives are completed.

Deploy immediately from the landing ship Novocherkassk and land at the the forward staging area on Moray island to await assignment of local transportation to the main island of Malden. 

Operation will begin at 0200.

<br />

**OPPOSING FORCES**
<br />
The Maldenese Defense Force totals six battalions comprising a brigade-size force. These battalions are referred to as Regiments owing to its heritage as a British possession. They will be referred to by their native identification for this intel.

1. Regiment MDF
Mechanized infantry battalion. First rate unit equipped with M60A3 MBTs and a mixture of M113 and AAV APCs. This battalion's companies have been dispersed throughout Malden following the coup to secure roads and villages and is constantly changing positions, but has not been seen at the airport within the past week.

2. Regiment MDF
Motorized infantry battalion. First rate unit equipped with the MOWAG Piranha APC. This battalion is concentrated in the area surrounding the airport. Some companies are still in barracks awaiting call to mobilize. HQ is identified at Interest Point 2. It is likely action around the airport will involve elements of this unit.

3. Regiment MDF
Motorized infantry battalion. Second rate unit equipped with soft skin vehicles only. This battalion's companies are concentrated in the southern port region in Le Port.

4. Regiment MDF
Airborne infantry battalion. First rate unit equipped with S-70 and Bell 205 transport helicopters in its airborne infantry companies. The battalion has an integrated light attack company with MD-500 helicopters with ATGMs. This battalion's companies have dispersed to numerous small sites to act as observation following the coup, with elements still housed at the airport.

5. Regiment MDF
Motorized infantry battalion. Reservist battalion equipped with soft skin vehicles only. This battalion is not yet fully mobilized.

6. Regiment MDF
Motorized infantry battalion. Reservist battalion equipped with soft skin vehicles only. This battalion is assisting 1. Regiment MDF in securing roads and villages where heavier vehicles are not a priority.

The United Kingdom has a small technical team and fighter wing based at the north end of the airport. This consists of a number of pilots and ground crew, as well as a company for security. The BAF operates Malden's air defense systems as part of their defense agreement. To ensure they do not provide complications for the occupation, the BAF's air assets as well as the air defense systems must be destroyed.

There are a total of 6 known F-35 air superiority fighters based at the airport, and flights have been testing the airspace around the Black Sea Fleet for the past few days. It is unknown if they will sortie within the next few hours.

There are three batteries of air defense systems deployed around Malden, one of which is permanently based at the airport and must be disabled. Each battery has three TELs. These TELs are mobile and will be accompanied by a targeting radar which also must be destroyed.

At this time it is NOT politically acceptable for the BAF personnel to be harmed. It is strongly encouraged that their assets be destroyed without engaging personnel directly. If possible and necessary, detaining the BAF personnel is acceptable.

In addition to the local military forces, civilian law enforcement is assisting with the control of civilians around road checkpoints and in towns. If local law enforcement attempt to obstruct your objectives, you are free to engage those units as hostiles.

Enemy helicopter patrols are possible threats before or during overt combat. Advise bringing zipties for controlling civilians or BAF personnel.

<br />

**FRIENDLY SUPPORT**
<br />
Friendly separatist detachment has agreed to wait in reserve or serve as diversionary force before airfield assets are handled. Discuss these plans with friendly forces on site.

Once enemy air, air defense, and radar assets are destroyed, friendly air support will be available, flight of two Su-33 fighter bombers armed with precision guided bombs, rockets, and AGMs: callsign ZHATKA.

Civilian traffic is controlled but not restricted in most areas, a covert approach to objectives using civilian vehicles and clothing may be possible.
