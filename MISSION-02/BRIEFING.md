<br />

**BACKGROUND**
<br />
The main airport in Malden has been secured by airborne units. Your battalion is the first of the brigade to reach combat readiness after being airlifted to Malden. 

The roads leading out of the airport have been secured, and a major crossroads at Saint Louis has been locked down. The enemy has given up attacks on Saint Louis and has spent the afternoon preparing defensive positions at La Trinite. 

The airborne units have little heavy equipment, and enemy anti-air assets are restricting their mobility. They are contesting the town of Larche as well as the highlands in the northwest part of the island but are otherwise static.

Your unit cohesion is low and not all equipment for the battalion has been deployed. Wheeled APCs are the only armored vehicles light enough to arrive this early.

<br />

**SITUATION**
<br />
You are part of platoon KINZHAL.

The enemy's 1. Mechanized Regiment is redeploying to hold the main coastal road connecting the airport to Le Port in the south. Until this road is taken, we are out of communication with friendlies to the south.

The key crossroad town of Dourdan connects the main highway to the only mountain pass outside of Le Port. Cutting this crossroad means that enemy units caught between friends at Saint Louis and Le Port will not have anywhere to withdraw. This could destroy a significant portion of the 1. Mechanized Regiment.

Your platoon must push through the defenses at La Trinite and seize the town of Dourdan. You must then hold it against enemy counterattack until relieved. Expect the enemy to attempt to break out from the south road once their situation is apparent.

As an aside, our position at the airport is being harassed by enemy mortar fire. This is causing flights in and out of the airport to be delayed between suppression missions against the enemy mortars. 

Locating and neutralizing the enemy mortars will help with the buildup of materiel this evening and put us in a better situation for tomorrow, but this is not your primary objective.
<br />

**OBJECTIVES:**
<br />
PRIMARY: <br>

(А - ANNA) Break through the enemy defenses at La Trinite.

(Б - BORIS) Secure the crossroads at Dourdan.

(В - VASILY) Defend Dourdan until relieved.

SECONDARY: <br>

(Г - GREGORY) Locate and neutralize the enemy mortar company somewhere near La Trinite.

<br />

**OPPOSING FORCES**<br />

Expected opposition is high.  The enemy is prepared and has built multiple defensive positions, including bunkers and wire. See attached recon images.

The main opposition will be elements of the 1. Mechanized Regiment. There has been increased activity from the 4. Airborne Regiment's helicopters throughout the day, so measures should be taken to protect against air attack.

1. Regiment MDF Mechanized infantry battalion. First rate unit equipped with M60A3 MBTs and a mixture of M113 and AAV APCs. This battalion is reorganizing on the main coastal road at Dourdan and defending at La Trinite and Le Port. It has lost one company and is estimated at around 70% strength.<br>

2. Regiment MDF Motorized infantry battalion. First rate unit equipped with the MOWAG Piranha APC. This battalion is defending the highlands near Larche. It has merged two of its depleted companies nd is estimated at around 70% strength.<br>

The battalion has an integrated light attack company with MD-500 helicopters with ATGMs. This battalion's companies have dispersed to numerous small sites. Slight losses incurred from combat in the vicinity of the airport.<br>
