<br />

**SUCCESS**
<br />
All main objectives were successfully accomplished. Airborne forces will begin an assault without threat of long range air defense. MDF communications are still confused on what exactly is happening. The general assumption is that a counter-coup is underway by local forces. 

<br />

<br />
(А - ANNA) **COMPLETE** <br />
Make contact with separatist forces at Mission Point 1 and secure support and equipment required for completion of further objectives 

(Б - BORIS) **COMPLETE** <br />
Neutralize the maritime radio warning station at Mission Point 2

(В - VASILY) **COMPLETE** <br />

*The missing Gazprom officials have not been rescued, though their location is known and will be tracked for rescue promptly.*

(Ж - ZHENYA) **COMPLETE** <br />
Avoid severe damage to runway or support facilities at airport, barring objective radar facilities
