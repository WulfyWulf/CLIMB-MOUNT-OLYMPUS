<br />

**SUCCESS**
<br />
All main objectives were successfully accomplished. Airborne forces will begin an assault without threat of long range air defense. MDF communications are still confused on what exactly is happening. The general assumption is that a counter-coup is underway by local forces. 

<br />

**OBJECTIVES:**
<br />
(А - ANNA) **COMPLETE** Make contact with separatist forces at Mission Point 1 and secure support and equipment required for completion of further objectives 

(Б - BORIS) **COMPLETE** Neutralize the maritime radio warning station at Mission Point 2

(В - VASILY) **COMPLETE** Neutralize the air surveillance radar at Mission Point 3

(Г - GREGORY) **COMPLETE** Neutralize the long range mobile SAMs and associated radars at Mission Point 4

(Д - DMITRI) **COMPLETE** Neutralize the RAF F-35s on their ramps at the BAF Depot at Mission Point 5

(Е - ELENA) **PARTIALLY COMPLETED** Locate and Secure interned Gazprom officials if still present at airport. Do not allow any harm to come to them *The missing Gazprom officials have not been rescued, though their location is known and will be tracked for rescue promptly.*

(Ж - ZHENYA) **COMPLETE** Avoid severe damage to runway or support facilities at airport, barring objective radar facilities

(З - ZINAYDA) **COMPLETED HARD** Neutralize any non-friendly MDF elements that present themselves

(И - IVAN) **PARTIALLY COMPLETED** Avoid politically embarrassing casualties to the local civilian population or BAF personnel *Conflict with the BAF personnel is unfortunate but understandable. Restraint with the local civilians and police was effectively handled.*

<br />

**IMPACT**
<br />
The conclusion of this operation has given the pacification of Malden strong momentum.
