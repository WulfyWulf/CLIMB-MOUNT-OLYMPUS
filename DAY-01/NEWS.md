**MAY 6 - NEW YORK**

Continuing yesterday's coverage of Russia's invasion of the Republic of Malden, the international response to the Kremlin's statement defending its violation of Malden's soveriegnty has been stern. The United Kingdom has been the strongest voice in opposition, demanding Russian troops immediately withdraw from the island and announcing it would be deploying an emergency force to protect British nationals living in the former colony. 

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense claims that servicepeople of the British Armed Forces were deliberately attacked by the Russians, and alleges that fatalities have been reported among the small team protecting Britain's fighter wing based on Malden. 

So far, no other countries have joined the United Kingdom's commitment to sending troops to Malden, though the White House has been the first to announce immediate, additional sanctions on Russia. Representatives from France and Germany have expressed intent to impose individual sanctions on Russia until it withdraws from Malden, and there is expected to be a joint resolution formally announcing sanctions near in the future. 

For now, fighting continues on Malden as Russian forces have taken the main sea and airports on the island. Videos streamed from the ground show intense combat on the ground as the few roads on the island are fought over. 

Russian forces broadcast a warning in the morning to civilians living on the east side of the island to leave their homes immediately, and demanded the Maldenese Defense Forces declare all towns as open cities, or they would be attacked. A video shows the shocking scene of the town of La Trinite being levelled by rockets, and again the town of Dourdan. It is unknown how many civilians remained behind and were caught in the bombardment.

It is uncertain how long the Maldenese can last under this assault that has already seized nearly half the island in the first day. Videos shown on Russian TV show uncertain and confused prisoners of war being marched in orderly lines to the rear. A policeman gave a shellshocked interview to a Russian naval correspondent, "I turned the corner and there was a gun in my face, what could I do?" the exhausted looking man said, "They just appeared in the dark." 

When pressed to give a statement to satisfy Russian TV, the man simply said, "They treated everyone in our station well. I disarmed my men and later that morning troops came through to take us in a truck."

Coverage will continue as British forces arrive on Malden through the week. The Ministry of Defense did not clarify how those forces would arrive, now that the Russians control the main air and sea ports.

*"Russia didn't stop in Crimea. They went deeper into Ukraine and insisted that they weren't, even as their soldiers were being killed there. They're so bold now that they don't even bother to lie. They want a weak response to Malden to be the new norm."*

*"Is this what we want? To send troops to fight a nuclear-armed superpower, over control of an island we have no treaty or commitment to? Is this really what's best for America right now?"*

*"The President has already said that she is taking the situation very seriously, and we know that Washington and London are talking. So it's just a matter of time before Russia gets pressured out, either by force or by the economic consequences of their actions. They can't defend- can't hold an island against all of NATO."*
